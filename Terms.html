    18 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
</div>
<div>
    You and We agree to the following dispute resolution process for any legal
    controversy or legal claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
    the Website, any subscription to the Website or any other aspect of Our
    relationship (“Subject Legal Claim”).
</div>
<div>
    To help resolve any issues between Us promptly and directly, You and We
    agree to begin any arbitration within 15 days after a Subject Legal Claim
    arises; otherwise, the Subject Legal Claim is waived.
</div>
<div>
    In an attempt to find the quickest and most efficient resolution of Our
    issues, You and We agree to first discuss any issue informally for at least
    15 days. To do that, please send Your full name and contact information,
    Your concern and Your proposed solution by email to Us at
    cpv@prasannalawfirm.com. If We should need to discuss an issue with You, We
    will contact You using the email or mailing address on Your Account.
</div>
<div>
    If We do not reach an agreed upon solution after Our discussions for at
    least 15 days, You and We agree that any Subject Legal Claim that either of
    Us may have must be resolved through binding individual arbitration in
    India.
</div>
<div>
    There are two limited exceptions to this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
    provision: (a) either Party may pursue in small claims court any action
    that is within that jurisdiction, as long as the case proceeds on an
    individual basis only; (b) either Party may seek to enforce its patents,
    trademarks, copyrights or trade secrets in an appropriate state or federal
    court.
</div>
<div>
    You and Us also agree to arbitrate in each of Our individual capacities
    only, not as a representative or member of a class, and each of Us
    expressly waives any right to file a class action or seek relief on a class
    basis.
